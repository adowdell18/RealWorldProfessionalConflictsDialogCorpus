Know that you always have teammates and friends here for you that you can call upon at any time.,Everything in life happens for a reason. It is not up to you to decipher why they happened immediately. It's up to you to get back up and search for the opportunity it's leading you to. ,You are an incredibly talented and hard-working individual. The things you do here do not go unrecognized.
