"Hey, ease up on it a bit. These things are taken very seriously now and could lead to something you don't want hanging over your head.",I can't have this going on under my watch. Tone it down and I'll go to bat for you when the time comes.,"I love the motivation but, be careful of that last comment. You know how things are. Definitely let me know the next time something is up.

Your information is crucial to starting my review.","SFC Johnson, I am more than impressed. Keep up the good work with your troops. ","I think at this point I can go home for the day as you have it all figured out with the platoon, thanks SFC Johnson. ","Honestly, from what i have seen, I am not so sure I believe with your analysis. There are men missing from squads, we have a drinker and harassment. These are not things I take lightly. ","You seem to be sugarcoating a lot of the problems of the platoon, I need to take a deep look at you and the others to assess issues and see how we can move forward at full strength. ","SFC Johnson, are you seriously trying to say that drinking and harassment within the platoon can be dealt with using an informal conversation? You know the severity and consequences of these issues, what were you thinking?","That's simply not what I see. Your platoon is a mess, and it is clear your leadership is at fault. "
I look forward to seeing what the future holds with this platoon,,"It sounds like you are doing a fantastic job at leading the platoon, and I am thankful to have a platoon sergeant with so much positivity and skill.",This platoon is deserving of a pizza party.,"I like your positive attitude, but you need to do a better job with Sgt.

I would be very content with continuing this trend and moving along on the same path that you have started SFC Johnson.,"You should be very proud of this platoon and I am feel very comfortable about where everyone is at right now.

Let's keep on this path and push even harder to be the best. ,"I have to say, I am a little disappointed that Sgt Cramer is harassing other squad leaders and that you haven't done anything tangible about it. I know you're a great leader and I expected things like this to be taken care of.","Drinking problems are no joke. If you think Sgt Cramer has an issue, you should addressing it. If not professionally, then definitely as a battle buddy. You guys have to take care of each other.

,,,,,,,
SFC I appreciate everything you doing for you are an outstanding leader but I will have to speak to SRG Cramer personally to figure out what is exactly going on.,It seems like we have nothing to worry about since the platoon in the good hands but I will still have to check on Sgt Cramer just to make sure that everything is aright.,"You are squad is in the perfect shape, I appreciate all the hard work that you do.",You are doing the amazing job keep up the good work I am happy that I got into a unit where people take care of each other and do the right thing.,You have to look out for your people it looks like some individuals are not listening to you and do not admit your authority.,"You should know what is going on with each individual in your platoon that way you can help, do not be careless",DO you not know how to do your job?,I spoke to your soldiers and they said that you barely take care of them.

You have other duties you need to take care of. ","Its good to hear your side of the story about this platoon, but I have heard otherwise. This platoon still needs a lot of work when it comes to getting things done in a more efficient way. We will take care of this together.","SFC Johnson, from what you say, this platoon sounds like a hard working platoon. That is not what I have been seeing lately or what I've heard for that matter. I have seen a lot of people standing around and wasting time, fooling around. ","I am glad you think so highly of your platoon, but there are a lot of improvements to take care of, starting with the way you have been handling SGT Cramer's drinking problem. "
"SFC Johnson, your team has done great work here, but there's still much to improve. I look forward to working with you. ","SFC Johnson, I'm grateful for your forthright and constructive feedback, I am sure it will be useful in crafting our roadmap for the platoon. ",That's excellent to hear. I am excited to be working with such a high-functioning team.,"Great work, especially in your approach to dealing with SGT Cramer. ",We have a squad leader that has a drinking problem? Please elaborate. ,"You've said nothing but flattering things about the team here, I'm waiting to hear about the other side of this coin. ",How is it that you're telling me about a high-functioning platoon when we have a squad leader with a drinking problem? ,How is it that you've needed to correct SGT Cramer on his conduct more than one time? How is this man still responsible for leading and setting the example for our squad? 
In that case I can leave any disciplinary decision making dealing with Cramer to you as long as he is kept in line.,Between the both of us we can continue to keep sgt. Cramer on the right track.,"Alright, that is great to hear we are at full strength and everything is being handled right.",Good to hear the Platoon is being managed so well.,I think I'm going to have to take charge of any disciplinary action regarding Cramer from now on. We have a lot of work to do to fill vacant spots and get the platoon to full strength.,I'll need written reports of past discrepancies or incidents regarding Cramer.,If Cramer continually has had these issues why is it you have yet to set him straight once and for all?,Does Cramer have a drinking problem or is the platoon plagued by poor leadership like yourself?
"SFC Johnson, I do not plan on changing too much of what you have already started due to the high progress the platoon has already made. ","SFC Johnson, I appreciate everything you have done so far. I am not here to step on anyone's toes, I am just here to do my part and help relieve some stress off of everyone else. ","SFC Johnson, you have done such an amazing job. Have you ever considered dropping an OCS packet?","I am so grateful to have had you as the acting Platoon Leader, I already feel at ease to be working with you. ","I have heard about the things you have been doing around here, but judging by what I see, there is a lot more that needs improvement. ","You've done an okay job around here thus far, but I expected more. ","Well you must not be doing your job, if you keep having to pull SGT Crammer to side to talk to him. ",It seems to me like your a push over and soldiers are constantly going to run all over you.
I appreciate your openness and honesty regarding my soldiers. Please continue to update me on this particular situation.,Thank you for telling me that. These are things that I need to know. Let me know if there is anything else I should know about the platoon.,You are doing a good job around here. I appreciate your hard work as Acting Platoon Leader.,Your diligence and attention to detail does not go unnoticed. If you continue this work ethic you are looking at a promotion in the near future.,"I understand that you are trying to fill me in on all the details, but make sure that it is appropriate to the work we do as a platoon.","This may not be information that you should be telling me. If you have any problems with his actions, make sure that you either talk to him directly or provide specific instances of work-pertinent information.",This is not at all appropriate and you should not be speaking to me about this kind of information. This is going to get you in trouble.,Do not talk about your fellow soldiers behind their back like this. This is potential grounds for slander and I don't want to hear about it again.
I appreciate your input on the platoon.

You've made a positive impact on the platoon. I will look for additional opportunities for you to be a leader.,"While I appreciate all you've done so far, it just isn't enough to get the platoon where we need it to be. Try doing a little more.","As someone with more experience, you need to help others in the platoon more. You've only done what is already expected of you.",Why would you ever allow that type of behavior to occur at all? This is an outrageous lack of personal responsibility.,"I don't see why other people have such good things to say about you, since you obviously cannot be trusted to deal with problems."
Continue to praise about making smart choice to pull sgt into private meetings. However turn the discussion into a brainstorming session that gets both parties thinking and working together on a solution to help the sgt ,"I appreciated the forward thinking but we got to continue the mission of getting unit all under same page. I trust you can find a solution, you mind discussing a few",Decide to use same energy in response back to SFC to show confidence in his choice and that you are supporting him. Create a way that makes task of maintaining/improving unit a priority under his guidance to see how he responds,Put the ball in SFC court to continue the good job he has been doing. Praise him on how the high energy and attitude has been a positive affect on the unit,"Unfortunately, the unit only functions as its weakest link. If we have disorder than we are failing as leaders. Give him discussion why a team is only as strong as weakest link",Talk down to the SFC about how he should of been crushing the issue faster and not having to continually counsel same individual. Say if it happens again than he will face consequences ,Put the fear of God in the SFC to fix the problem for good but explain you want it done professionally and in a certain time frame. ,"Tell SFC the energy of his leadership is on point however, motivation to perform and act professionally needs to be addressed and fixed and that it falls on him to come up with the solution"
"SFC, it is pertinent to the platoon's success that we get all SQD Leaders working to standard.","SFC, we are only as strong as our weakest member.","SFC, I'm impressed by the work you have done so far.","SFC, I'm excited to work with a platoon that is already operating at a high level and tending to it's deficiencies.","SFC, I'm disappointed to hear you have a PLT with leadership like Cramer.","SFC, I see the second SQD leadership as a failure.","SFC, the failure of Cramer will rest on your shoulders.","SFC, you aren't doing your job by continuing to have toxic leadership like Cramer. "
"It sounds like everything is fairly squared away. However, I want you to keep me up to date on the issues with Sgt. Cramer; I do not want anyone being harassed in my platoon.",If that's the case then I would like to speak personally with Sgt. Cramer regarding his drinking issues. Send him in immediately.,Good work SFC Johnson; and keep an eye on SGT Cramer for me. Let me know if he causes problems again.,Good work SFC Johnson.,"SGT Cramers drinking problems should've been dealt with earlier, not just now that I'm getting here. Have you done anything at all to reign him in?",Why have these issues with the platoon not been taken care of earlier? If these have been recurring problems why am I the one that is just now working to correct them?,I want these problems with the platoon dealt with immediately and you will not leave until they have been.,I am severely disappointed that SGT Cramer has yet to be reprimanded for his drinking problem.

I'd like to do that before assuming anything.
You've done a great job with the platoon and like to continue to see your good performance.,"You are one of the best NCOs in this unit, keep it up.",SFC Johnson I see you as a future First Sergeant one day. I'll work to get you promoted.,"SFC Johnson, anything you need, I'll get for you, just ask me.","You've done a good job, but I've also heard from others that you don't care about soldiers",I hear you drop the ball on some missions however.,"However there are many deficiencies in the unit , you were the one in charge, and i am here to fix it.","Now that I am PL, this unit will operate 1000% better than you could ever have done."
"SFC Johnson, it is my pleasure to see such a good platoon as yours. I am really impressed with your brief and am looking forward to see them to get their works done as a team. ","SFC Johnson, I do not worry about Sgt. Cramer since you seem to be able to standardize him as you have assured me. Keep your good work and let me know if you have any problem with him.

Are you out of your mind? Wake up and get your shit done so I can actually do something with these people who call themselves soldiers pathetically.","SFC Cramer, you have not done to Sgt Cramer yet? You are out of your mind. I will see what I can do to the Sgt by my own. Do not assure me anything if you do not know how to handle it.","SFC Johnson, you think you are special? Your words are just meaningless and I cannot believe that you have informed me that the platoon is on standard. I will personally make them soldiers. ","SFC Johnson, if I find Sgt. Cramer causing me or my platoon any kind of a trouble, I guarantee you that you will not be able to walk away from the responsibility either. "
"How often is periodically? I'm glad that you reign him in when he goes to far, but do you think there is a way to stop the problem from happening in the first place? You know him well, and would be the best person to approach him about the issue.","Even if you do take him aside, do you think there is a way to keep it from happening altogether? The squad works together well already, it would be even better if this speed bump could be ironed out.","Outstanding, I'm glad that everything is running smoothly, and if you say it's not a problem, then I'll trust you on the matter.","Well, I guess theres no problem with a little drinking now and then, as long as the work gets done and you keep him in check.","This is a major problem SFC, your soldiers are being harassed by a squad leader on your watch. Don't try to downplay the seriousness of this situation.","What about if we brought new soldiers in to fill in the empty ranks, how do you think they would respond to being harassed by their new team leader?",This is a major blunder on your part SFC! You've neglected your role in this platoon entirely.,"We can't have this happening here, I want SGT. Cramer out of my unit ASAP, if it doesn't happen soon, I'll hold you personally responsible."
"I will determine who does what here,SFC .",Thanks for the heads up SFC.,"Good SFC, I can see you are doing a great job.",Thanks for the heads up.,"SFC, Are you trying to tell me how to do my job?","SFC, that is unprofessional  of you.","Excellent job SFC, I look forward to working with you.",I do not like to hear accusations with out evidence. 
I'm happy to hear that the platoon is functioning so well and that you're on top of the little issues before they escalate.,"Clearly what you're doing is working and I don't plan to change things up just for the sake of change, if there are small issues we'll fix them. I'm looking forward to working with you.",Let's talk about how we can improve the squad leader's disposition permanently. I want to hear what you think is the best plan of action.,Good work on being so on top of your platoon. I want updates on the squad leader's progress and any other issues.,"If there are issues in your squad that you're aware of and haven't been able to take care of yourself, I'm going to have to step in.","You clearly haven't solved the problem, you're treating the symptom and not the root issue. I will take care of this.","Why hasn't this been taken care of, the squad leader should have been counseled long ago. I do not approve of your actions.",You are really letting your squad down by allowing this squad leader to continue to act this way.
I think you've been doing well but lets talk more about Sgt Cramer's issues.,I think you've done well in handling the situation but let's see if i can chamge Sgt Cramer's behavior by talking with him now.,Let's keep it up! Introduce me to the other squad leaders!,"I'm very excited to be a part of this platoon, let's try to be the best in the company!","If Sgt Cramer's attitude hasn't changed, I don't think you've been doing a good job as the platoon leader.","We're only as good as our weakest member, you've compromised our platoon by allowing sgt Cramer's actions to continue.",Sgt Cramer is you're responsibility. Go handle it now before I have to do something about him AND you.,There is no excuse for you or sgt Cramer. Im going to speak to the company commander about you both.
We will try to work out a plan to solve this issue together.,I appreciate your involvement in this matter. Let us search for solutions to mitigate this issue. ,"Good job, sergeant! Keep up the good spirit!
",I will note your efforts in your next evaluation. ,"This is terrible, we need to work on company morale. ",This is unacceptable. We will have to do more than just pull him to the side once in a while. ,"It is your responsibility to ensure that such situations don't occur around here. You failed in your duties!
","I can't believe this is happening! I will have to counsel you for not responding to the situation in a more productive way!

Your ability to take care of your soldiers should be the standard.,"SFC Johnson, I see that you want to look after your soldiers but some things need to be reported. SGT Cramer's drinking issues can grow into larger problems as it seems like you needed to pull him aside several times.",I see how you don't want to affect unit cohesion by not stirring the pot but I expect professionalism from you when it comes to repeating issues like that of SGT Cramer.,"SFC Johnson I question your professionalism when you tell me you have pulled SGT Cramer aside not once but several times for a drinking issue. After his first warning, you should have counselled him.  ",Do you really think pulling someone aside is sufficient for dealing with SGT Cramer's repeating issue? You should have reprimanded him immediately. I need to know that you are doing your job as PSG and setting the standard for everyone.
I'm happy to hear the platoon is doing well. Let's have a normal day so that I can get a feel for the platoon.,I appreciate the work you and others have put in. I would like to go through the paperwork with you for me to transfer in as Platoon Leader.,"Awesome, Sergeant. Let's get out with the platoon and keep up the good work.","Great work, I want to start working on our platoon tasks for today. Let's keep up the awesome work!","Easy there, Sergeant. Lets slow down and take things step by step and do this by the book.","Lets keep things professional in terms of Sergeant Cramer, I would like to form my own opinion about him.",Do you think a Squad Leader who can't control his drinking is not a problem for the platoon? You better explain yourself right now.,How many times have you let Sergeant Cramer get away with drinking too much? This could damage the Soldiers faith in their leadership.

Thanks for that information. I will look into Sgt. Cramer and see what steps can be taken to improve his character. ,You are doing a great job handling Sgt. Cramer. Keep up the good work. ,Please keep telling me all that you do to keep this platoon in order. I would love to learn your ways.,You are one of the elite service members that we have. All the people in the platoon look up to you. ,I have not had the opportunity to address SGT. Cramer myself. I would like to see how he is before making any judgements.  ,"If SGT. Cramer is giving that kind of attitude to others, why hasn't the issue been resolved already? Why now are you bringing it up to me?",You should have tooken care of SGT Cramer already. It should no longer be an issue. Are you even doing your job?,You are suppose to be the best in your platoon. You set the standards. Why is SGT Cramer still acting out under your command?

I am greatly anticipating working with you and this great platoon!,"I am thrilled to hear that the soldiers are so well disciplined, it sounds like we will have a great platoon!",I respect how you handle the situation with Sgt. Cramer but I think you could have done things a little differently.,"I'd like to have all squads at full strength, why have you been going with third and fourth squad down a man.","I completely disagree with how you've been dealing with Sgt. Cramer, if his drinking is detrimental to those around him why have you not removed him from his position? ",I think you have some major flaws with how you've been working with the platoon.

We will handle any issues together as they arise.,I could not ask for a better transition. Thank you for being so helpful. I will make sure to handle all issues as they come along.,I am disappointed to hear that these problems with Sgt. Cramer have gone on for so long. We may have to take more serious action to correct his behavior.,How could we be short soldiers in our unit? Why did you let this problem continue? We need to be at full strength as soon as possible.,"SFC Johnson, I cannot believe you were in charge for this long. The platoon is a mess and it's all your fault.","You say the platoon is in good shape, but all I see are negatives. We have a lot of work to do before we are in good shape and it's all due to your lack of leadership."
"SFC Johnson, thank you for bringing this too my attention. I am happy to hear that you are up to date on your squad leaders. Regarding Sgt. Cramer, I trust that you will keep him in check and keep me updated that his behaviors change for the worse. ",I thank you for your diligence in keeping track of your squad leaders. I trust you will make the right decision regarding SGT Cramer. ,,,"SFC Johnson,  I need you to take control of SGT Cramer. Get to this immediately as it is important that my Platoon SGT be always correcting his platoon. I am dissapointed that this hasn't been fixed yet.",,Why haven't you fixed this already? It reflects poorly on you that this has gone on to this degree. ,
Sgt. Johnson keep up the good work. Our platoon cannot afford to have these types of issues,"As long as Sgt. Cramer's problems do not become a distraction, I ","Sgt. Johnson, you seem to have good control of this platoon. Keep up the good work.",,"Sgt. Johnson, I trust that you know we have a zero-tolerance harassment policy here. Handle it before I get involved.","Sgt. Johnson, shame on you for allowing this harassment to happen periodically. ","Sgt. Johnson, where is Sgt. Cramer? I want to speak with him -- now!","Sgt. Johnson, if I hear the smallest discussion about Sgt. Cramer's harassment problem, I will see that you and the Sgt receive a disciplinary recommendation. "
"I am glad to hear that things are going so well. However, it sounds like you may have an issue with one of your men that needs attention. ","Johnson, I am glad to hear that you periodically pull him aside but it sounds like we may need a more serious approach. ","Excellent, I am glad to hear that you are overseeing things here. It is good that you have taken measures to control such behaviors. ",I can tell that you have a good understanding of the platoon and I will certainly be trusting your judgment moving forward. ,"While I am glad to hear you think you have done well, I think you have handled a serious issue very poorly. ","When dealing with issues of harassment, merely pulling someone aside is not enough. You are now liable. ", You have no idea what you're doing. You clearly are under trained for your position. ,Why are you so dumb? You should have never spoken to me about this. 
"SFC Johnson, I really appreciate you bringing this up, the platoon is only as strong as it's weakest link. Rest assured when I meet with SGT Cramer, we will discuss how we may be able to alleviate any problems from arising again.","SFC Johnson, thank you for bringing this situation to my attention. Best believe that I will try my very best to have the entire platoon performing at its upmost capacity, and that includes building up what may be our weakest link.","SFC Johnson, I am honored to be involved in a platoon that is hardworking and motivating. Best believe that as a team, we will continue to flourish, maintaining platoon morale, efficiency, and exceeding current performance, along with SGT Cramer.","SFJ Johnson, our platoon is only as strong as a weakest link. However, by working in cohesion, no matter the problems that may arise, we will make sure this platoon continues to exceed its great performance. ","SFC Johnson, as great as this platoon has been performing, the platoon is only as strong as its weakest link, and if that's the case, I'd say you're not doing your full duty as platoon sergeant. SGT Cramer needs to get on line or you will continue to fail","SFC Johnson, being that you have been acting PL, you should have already taken care of this problem with SGT Cramer. Everything the platoon does or does not do falls on you too, if you fail, I fail. We cannot let this go on any longer.","SFC Johnson have you lost your mind? How do you tolerate subordinates to exert their problems to the rest of the platoon? Especially alcohol related. This is completely unacceptable. Mind you, this will not happen again, set him straight ASAP, understand?","SFC Johnson, if you allow alcohol to influence the rest of the platoon, then you have clearly failed as an acting PL and PSG. This will not be tolerated and I will hold you accountable for this, fixing it will be your number 1 priority. Don't fail me."

I can't imagine all the sleepless nights you've had. I just want you to know that these sleepless nights will in fact continue, unfortunately. ","SFC Johnson, I am completely exhausted just listening to all the work that you have done so far. Has no one else did as much as you? I am bewildered that there is even a drunk person in your platoon.","SFC Johnson, I can't believe that you would air out Sgt Cramer's dirty laundry like that! Would you like it if I just spread rumors to your higher command as well?","SFC Johnson, have you ever thought that Sgt Cramer drinks because of you? You sound like a terrible SFC and especially because you are tattle telling on your fellow subordinates. You disgust me."
"Sergeant, I appreciate your hard work as the acting
Platoon leader. I will be reaching out to you in the 
following days but I will take care of it from here.","I got it from here, Sergeant. I will make sure you are 
recognized later for your work but you can relax now and

"Don't worry about your ERB, SFC Johnson. So long as you are doing what you are supposed to be doing and getting the job done, your ERB will take care of itself. As far as I'm concerned, you're doing great. ","Relax. You're doing an excellent Job SFC Johnson, keep up the good work!",Keep pushing forward and do more in less time!,I like your enthusiasm and energy today.

You need to improve your physical fitness if you are going to lead by exampl",Why are we so behind in personal rediness as  platoon? I gave you a list of things that needed to get done by this week and you have failed to meet my expectations.,Why did the platoon perform at such a low level during the last FTX? What can we do to better so we don't repeat the same mistakes?,"I'm hearing rumors that you are not performing your duties and holding a double standard with your subordinates, is this true?"
"SFC Johnson, it seems you have been doing a great job; I definitely want you to continue the good work and I look forward to working with you as my PSG.", I’m very happy to hear that things are going so well in the platoon; I do hope to keep that trend going. Nothing in life is perfect; however even the minor problems that you have mentioned can be fixed.,"SFC Johnson, you’re a beast; not only have I heard that you were a great platoon leader without any officer training, something that I had to go to school for, but, you were also able to keep the platoon in great shape. That is IMPRESSIVE!!"," SFC Johnson, you deserve to be a 1SG; I see a promotion in your near future.  I haven’t known you that long, but you seem to be an outstanding soldier who will go far in whatever endeavors you decide to partake."," SFC Johnson, you need to pull this platoon together; it is not acceptable to have 2 squads short or to have a drunk for a squad leader. This is something I hold you responsible for as the acting platoon leader.","This platoon is a mess; I’m not going to lead a drunk. Pulling SGT Cramer to the side is not the answer. As a senior non-commissioned officer, I expect you to know better than that. Pull yourself together, SFC Johnson.","SFC Johnson, your platoon is the worst I’ve ever had to lead. You and your soldiers are a disgrace to the U.S. Army. If you can’t get rid of a drunk from your platoon or stop him from drinking, you and SGT Cramer both don’t deserve to be in the Army.",Periodically pulling SGT Cramer to the side to set him straight is plain laziness. A good senior non-commissioned officer would have fixed the problem long ago instead of just sitting back and doing nothing.  You’re definitely not the PSG that I need to help me lead this platoon.
Sounds like you have things well in hand.  I can’t wait to move forward together to further improve the platoon.,Glad to hear the platoon is doing well.  I am looking forward to moving forward to correct the few issues that are outstanding.,Excellent job Sgt.,Sounds like you have things well in hand.,Sounds like although you have tried you need some help pulling the platoon together .,Looks like you have done all you can at this time so I will help you sort out these last few problems.,Sounds like there are many issues that are unresolved within the Platoon.

SFC Johnson based on your feedback it is clear you have a very hard working platoon and that you are doing a great job. I will continue to monitor the action of SGT Cramer and should any issues of harassment occur we may have to consider finding another SQD leader for 2nd SQD.,"SFC Johnson thank you for taking time to explain the different dynamics of the platoon. I realize some of the SQD are short handed and I will do my best to address that issue, in the meantime let make sure the NCO’s keep up their hard work.

I am very excited to work with you but I can see you have everything under control and the team consists of very hard working personnel,SFC Johnson it is certainly an honor to be the PL for such a squared away team of professionals.

Maybe we could have prevent the poor solders who have been harassed by him from withstanding such a terrible circumstances if you had of handled the situation in a more direct way the first time.,"SFC Johnson the feedback you have provided is very much appreciated. Lets consider our platoon, do you really think it is fair that some squads are short handed? That must put a lot of stress on the members of the Platoon. Why are you allowing your men and women to be over worked? I feel we need to revaluate what they can tolerate, some of them have families and spouses that need them as well.", SFC Johnson the feedback you have provided regarding the SQD is really unacceptable. How can you let harassments from SGT cramer become repetitive acts? You are exuding poor leadership skills in doing so and if you do not replace him I will be forced to replace you.,SFC Johnson yes the men and women of this platoon are hard working but it is apparent that you have lead them astray by allowing SGT Cramer to remain as a SQD leader. You are directly condoning his actions and you may as well be the one guilty of such actions. What on earth is wrong with you. A person of your rank should be more competent. I will have to think about allowing you to continue as a leader with this platoon.
You did a good job leading the team for a short period of time. I will take what you said under advisement.,You are doing well at keeping up with tasks and purposes. Now is the time to transition back into the follower roll to continue to sharpening your skills,Excellent job as a temporary leader. I think a positive spot report will further your career.,You keep being a leader even though you are not in front and it will pay off.  Thank you for bring the drinking to my attention.,Why did you not bring the drinking to my attention earlier? Leaders look out for their subordinates and you failed them by allowing it to continue.,You did not get squad 3 and 4 up to full strength and that is a failure. You should have done more to get us to full strength,"You did a horrible job as a leader. The drinking is a direct reflect on your leadership style. Leaders should be loud and public about humiliating people. By not publicly addressing the drinking, you enabled it.",Leaders do not do anything wrong. You did everything wrong. We are not at full strength and a negative counseling should light a fire under you to get stuff done.
"Johnson, Sgt. Cramers situation does seem off. Let me get back to you on that.",Sounds like you have things well in hand.  I can’t wait to move forward together to further improve the platoon.,If you get any more problems let me know. Don’t worry about sgt.

Lets keep it up and make sure this Platoon maintains high readiness.,Thank you SFC Johnson! Lets get to work on those squads and squad leader to make sure this Platoon is combat ready!,"SFC Johnson, that's not good enough, you have to make sure this platoon is ready at all times. We need to start working on making sure these squads are in top shape.",I need to have a talk with Sgt. Cramer. His actions are unacceptable and needs to change.,Well clearly you haven't done enough to work on Sgt. Cramer's problem if he is still having issues. It is your job to make sure your squad leaders are in line.,Why are you satisfied with this minimal results? You have two squads short a man and a squad leader with a drinking problem!
I am glad to hear that the company is donig well and that third and fourth squad are full!

Things like that could definitely effect group cohesion!,Thank you for informing me of these issues! Drinking could definitely be an issue in the future so I will pay close attention to Cramer!,"I would like to focus on the positives of the soldiers rather than point out their deficiencies.
",Have you tried asking Cramer if he is having any other issues? His excessive drinking could be cause by outside influences. ,Do you think it is professional to gossip to me about other soldiers?,I think you should mind your own business and not be so quick to point out negative qualities of soldiers. How about you tell me something good that these soldiers have done.
"This is good information to know, I'll keep an eye out in case these situations develop further.",Ill make sure to deal with this if it becomes an issue.,"I ever knew that tell me more about him, I want to make sure I fully understand.",Is there anyone else that is having issues in the platoon that I should know about.,"Ill deal with these scenarios as they come up, but let me be the judge of people myself. ",Lets not talk about peoples personal problems right now.,I don't think you should be discussing other peoples business SFC Cramer.,"Ill figure that out myself, I dont need you to talk bad about people to me behind there backs."
"That's good information to know, and I love the enthusiam, but let's save talk like that for a later time in a more professional setting.","You seem like you have a good grasp on the platoon status, and I'm sure we can figure out something to help SGT Cramer's situation.","Hell yeah! I love the energy, let's get to work!","Hooah! Great job staying on top of things, let's keep this platoon working well!","Well we need to do something about Sgt Cramer then, and it bothers me that this is a situation that's clearly gone on for too long.",Why would you tell me something like that outside of the correct line of communication? We need to establish some professional guidelines immediately.,"Well, why the hell hasn't Cramer's situation been addressed properly seeing as it's a repeat offense?","Clearly, since one of your sergeants is still having such issues, I was wrongly informed about your competence as a leader."
SFC Johnson we need to maintain this good level of work and keep doing what has been working since before i got to this platoon.,"I like what you have done for this platoon SFC Johnson help mentor me to, to help me do what you are able to do when you were acting platoon leader.",That's great to hear SFC Johnson lets continue the high standard for this platoon.,Awesome job SFC Johnson cant wait to keep up the great work with you.,That is good SFC Johnson but why don't we focus more on our squad leader who has a drinking problem and help correct that because that is more of a problem.,That is good we are a great platoon but two squads are missing people and a squad leader has a drinking problem.,All that sounds good but you don't care about your soldiers because you aren't helping a squad leader who has a drinking problem. That is a failure by you platoon SGT.,You are not that good of a platoon SGT if we are missing soldiers and one has a drinking problem and harasses people.
Thank you. That's good to know. I'll make sure to keep an eye out for that., Good job dealing with SFC Johnson. I'll make sure to stay on him.,Thank you for that. I'm happy that the platoon has had someone like you here to keep him in check and maintain unit cohesion.,"You've done exemplary work for the unit, Sergeant. This will definitely weigh heavily into the first NCOER I write for you.","Thank you for that information, but as PL, I'll be making my own determinations about the soldiers I lead.","As acting PL you had the power to do that, but now that I'm taking over the role, under no circumstances are you to reprimand SGT Johnson again.","Gossip like this is highly unprofessional. Without having given me the chance to feel out my leadership on my own, you've attempted to influence my opinion of another NCO in our unit. Do no to that again.",Your willingness to gossip about your colleagues gives me pause -- were you truthfully being helpful or were you trying to get a leg up on who you see as competition?

If he's repeating his offenses, you may be giving an ineffective counseling that you might think is effective. ","SFC Johnson, SGT.

",In the future SFC Johnson you will present me with documentation and a written statement of any issues with soldiers within the platoon before you make accusations without any supportive documentation.,"SFC Johnson, I understand you have made me aware of this issue with SGT Cramer but what are you doing to solve it? If you continually have to pull him aside to straighten him out do you thing he's the best person for SL?

I'd like to hear some of your ideas since you're experienced working with him,I like your willingness to help your fellow soldiers out. That's a good quality for us to build on.,Why did you immediately go to chewing SFC Kramer out as the best option?,Is chewing SFC Kramer out the most productive way to help him?,Why did you immediately start chewing out SFC Kramer? Have you ever led before?,SFC Kramer's lack of discipline is a representation of the leadership he's getting from his own leaders. That means you!
Thank you for the overview and feedback on that specific soldier. Aside from the conversations you have had with him what else has been done to assist with his bad drinking habits and method in which he approaches other sqd leaders? ,Thank you for the information!

You are doing a goo job an handling the situation well. Continue to address the problem as needed and keep on doing what you are doing.,It sounds like you have the situation under control. As long as you are handling the situation then I will not intervene.,That is great news the way that you are handling the SFC. Let me buy you a beer because of the exceptional way that you handled the situation.,That is amazing. Could you teach me the way that you handle problems such as this one. I want to learn from you.,That is probably not the best way to be handling the situation. You should be reprimanded.,Why would you talk to him in that way. You are not doing the best job showing the Platoon that you have their back when it comes to SFC.,Are you kidding me?! You handled this situation in the worst possible way imaginable. You are a moron and I will look to try and get disciplinary actions taken upon you for your actions.,"You have not helped the situation in any way shape or form.

",I'm disappointed that more besides verbal reprimands is not being done to correct SGT Cramer's continued misbehavior. ,I would expect you to do more regarding SGT Cramer's demeanor. Harassment in the ranks that is unfounded or may stem from a drinking problem should not be tolerated. ,Do you really think that a verbal reprimand is enough of a punishment for drunken harassment? ,SGT Cramer's continued insubordination is a direct reflection of your negligence and unwillingness to discipline your subordinate leadership.

If you need anything from me please do not hesitate to ask!,Well sir everything is almost perfect but that is all you can ask of just one man you have done the best you possible could.,"If only Sergeant Cramer listened to you, I guess he just does not respect you enough to conform to your wishes",Well how long have the third and fourth squad been short a man? If you were an actual good leader those spots would have been filled by now.,I guess you are just to soft of a man to get Sergeant Cramer to stop causing trouble.

Your so close to have a perfect platoon but, I guess almost perfect is good enough.","Well I guess this one man can only do so much, maybe Cramer would have more respect for you if you were not so old. Youngsters like him have no respect for their elders.","Your Platoon would be perfect if not for the missing spots in the third and fourth squads plus that second platoon leader, but I guess this is good enough",You are obviously not very good at leading if you keep pulling Cramer to the side and he still keeps getting in trouble.

You very evidently care for the health and performance of your platoon, and I hope that I can measure up to you in the same way.","SFC Johnson, I am impressed by your hard work and care. If possible, I will do what I can to see that you are appropriately rewarded.","SFC Johnson, I am unsure of the current state of things just yet, but I highly doubt that they are of as high a magnitude as you claim them to be. You should take into consideration other factors before making assumptions. This mars my image of you.","SFC Johnson, I am disappointed that you have not shown more initiative in solving these problems yourself. You may have made attempts before, but you certainly could have done more.","SFC Johnson, your criticisms are absolutely ludicrous! You are far too quick to wag your tongue but painfully slow to act on anything. It seems to me that you are a man of far too many words and few too many actions.","SFC Johnson, you whine too much. The platoon seems fine to me. You are in no position to point fingers here, and I can see no sensibility in what you have said. Fortunately, I plan to be a superior platoon leader."
"After showing much excitement, he later became satisfied and he is calm in the very end.","Knowing that he is successful, he was able to get through the trouble and pretty much is relieved (relaxed).",The man really enjoys the job at being the SFC.,He seems to basically look forward on doing this job and with no troubles besides on thinking about happiness.,"He was enjoying his job, until he realizes that he was ineligible to proceed any further with his job and all due to age.",He was looking at a bright future and thinking that all the fun had never ended. Later he realized that he was diagnosed with brain cancer and he cannot continue on due to that condition.,"He was hired on the first day, then he was fired the very next day.","He was enjoying his job, then one of his squad members sabotaged his vehicle."
Congratulation Johnson!!!! I promote you as the new platoon leader and please take the whole day to relax!!,"Johnson, you worked really hard and i'm giving you this promotion. Please take the whole day off to celebrate your day!!!","Tomorrow Johnson, you are leading the squad to victory!!","Keep doing what ever you are doing Johnson, you will be promoted higher than now!!!",Mr. Johnson hope you are enjoying your job. I heard that you have brain cancer and i'm sorry i will have to let you go.,"Mr. Johnson, i heard your wife passed away and i need you to take a month off your duties and pay your respects.","Mr. Johnson, you get out of my company!!! Give me your badge and your stripes.. You are not worthy.","Mr. Johnson, I'm letting you go due to all the acts that you have performed. It's illegal and hand me your damn badge."
Awesome! You accomplished a lot!!!,Wow  great job! You should take some time for yourself.. You have done good,Keep up the good work!,We should celebrate.,Great job!,"There were a lot of flaws, though. You still did not do as well as previous times.",Good job.,I could do better though.

SFC Johnson should be excited that he has become first sergeant and leader of platoon leader. ,He is relaxed and calm when he hears the positive review.,"""You inform him that you've heard about the outstanding work he has done as Acting Platoon Leader and express your excitement""",Elated about the good news,He is excited about making a change in the company ,"""He ensures you that while this has been an issue he periodically pulls Sergeant Cramer to the side to set him straight, when necessary. ”",He is elated to hear the new ,he becomes frustrated when he speaks on the company's weakness
All of that is great but you should be better at correcting sergeant Cramer .,,That is wonderful that your platoon is doing so well and I cant wait to work with you in the future.,,You are a failure at your job and you should be fired.,,Why in the heck is your platoon not in order it would be a disgrace to work with you . ,
