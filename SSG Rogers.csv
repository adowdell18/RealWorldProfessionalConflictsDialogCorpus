Thanks!","I just heard about that awesome breakfast you had. You were super late, but as long as you come in next time with a plate for me, it's all gravy. Biscuits and gravy, that is!!!",Hahaha you're a damn good soldier and I love the fact that you've learned how to game the system and get the job done while looking out for your guys. That early police call time is suggested but DEFINITELY not mandatory!!!,"Rogers, you must be out of your mind coming in here late like this. You're already getting counseled for being late for your duties, now add another counseling for being late to show up to a meeting with your PL.","Since you like to waste time, I'm going to waste some of yours (tells Rogers to wait in the waiting room, leaves him there fro 3 hours).","Rogers, you want to play stupid games?

Maybe I'll be done writing up my Article 15 for you by then too.","How about since you took 15 minutes of my time today, I take away 15 hours of your pay for this period?

Your distracting conversations are probably why you've been having severe performance issues lately.,Maybe these larges breakfasts are slowing you down. I know that your performance sure indicates that.,"Frankly, you need to stop talking about unimportant things when you're on my time. Your recent performance shows that you're slow and lazy too.",Your weekend pass is canceled. Surely you'll arrive on time for a detail on Saturday?

I'd like you to try to improve on that this week!","SSG Rogers! How was breakfast? SFC Smothers told me about your time management issue.

Then, let's discuss why you're so fucking late today. You knew damn well what time this meeting was, and yet I see you strolling in here 15 minutes late. So explain yourself.",
,,,,,,,
I hope you are having a pleasant morning and I'm not worried about you being late.,I love scrambled eggs with sausage you have pretty good taste.,I know that sometimes its hard to secure transportation so I won't reprimand you for missing the HQ detail hit time.,As long as the duty got done I don't care what time you did it.,You are far from a promotion if you keep up this terrible performance and you will be reprimanded for missing hit times in the future.,You have no more chances. If you miss another hit time I will take rank and I will take pay.,"You are an outright failure. You have failed your platoon, your company and the Army. ",I am taking rank and pay as of now and you are going to make up for the times you have been late. You will serve time for going AWOL.
"I heard what you had for breakfast. Thats one of my favorites too, but about the last few weeks. Is there anything going on I should know about, any issues or problems that are affecting performance?",I need you to just walk me through the last couple of weeks and let me know what you think has been good and bad about your performance. Then we can discuss those things.,"You have proven yourself ti be a highly effective leader when you put your mind to it, we just need you to do that on a steady, regular basis",Youre an asset to our platoon and we need you. I want you to come up with a list of all the problems you see in our platoon and how we can fix them. Then we will discuss them.,"Your performance has been lackluster as of late, youre late this morning, and you always have excuses. If this continues we will have to take it up the CoC","You need to stop with the excuses, just do your job the way youre capable of and we wont have any more issues",I think your behavior is just a result of you being lazy and settled. You need to stop being selfish and immature and do your job,"If your behavior doesnt improve, I will see to it that you face UCMJ action for repeated failures."
"how was breakfast? how has the last couple of weeks been treating you, i would like to ask you a couple of minor questions.",Are you ready for the weekend? lets discuss a couple things i can see you improving on.,"You're doing great, I have nothing of importance to talk to you about. Any questions before i send you on your way?","I really love breakfast my self, time management is not important in the army.","you are so lazy, pick up your act before your soldiers start acting like you.",I haven't seen anyone act like this since i was in college. People who act like you get kicked out of the army.,until further notice. I want you reporting to my office 2 hours before any hit times.,"nobody gives a crap about you. you are too lazy to be in my unit anymore, i'm going to do my best to have you removed. "
"Keep up the work that you've been doing so far, just tighten it up and work harder at performing well.",,"You have had inconsistent performance in the past, I need you to tighten your shot group.  I believe you can be the best section leader in this platoon and I want to make sure that happens, so if you need any help don't be afraid to ask.",,You have performed well in the past and I want to bring you back to that level again. ,,One thing I do not tolerate is blaming someone else for your failures.  For the next month you will be in charge of arranging transportation for the platoon as well as CQ duty every Friday and Saturday night.,"You are responsible for your own mistakes!  You have performed well in the past and until you do so again, you will have CQ shifts every Friday and Saturday night!"
Well nice of you to drop by. Please have a seat.,I overheard you talking about breakfast. I love eggs!,"Come on in! Good to see you, sergeant. How are you?","Well, well, look what the cat dragged in! Haha let's get this going.","We need to discuss your recent performance. I have witnessed various examples of your ineptitude and lack of attention to detail lately, and it worries me.","Sergeant, something is wrong and I know it. Your work has taken an obvious turn for the worse of late, and we need to nip it in the bud.",Get in here and sit down! How dare you show up late? I call this meeting to discuss your piss poor efforts lately and you lazily walk in to my office?! Completely unacceptable.,This is just another example of what a terrible NCO you are. Get your dumb butt in here so we can get this negative counseling underway. Then you can continue about your mediocre existence.
How has your morning been so far?,I just need to have a few minutes of your time to talk about some things.,"I hear you have been having several issues getting places on time, let's see if there is something we can do to make sure you meet your time hacks.",How about we work together to get you on track and keep you from missing hit times and inspections.,Your performance is dismal at best and you need to figure out how to stop letting down this platoon.,I need you to work harder to get places on time and I need you to work harder so your vehicles are inspection ready at all times and can pass inspections at all times.,You need to stop having casual conversations with everyone you meet and get where you need to go when you need to be there. ,It is not hard to make your time hacks and have your vehicles ready to go or plan transportation ahead of time but you are clearly making it much harder than it needs to be and that is utterly unacceptable.
"SGT I want to say that your performance has not been to my liking lately. Your constantly late, and I need you to change that and start being example to your squad.",Sgt I need you to start being on time for things and have your equipment ready to go.

What time did I tell you to be here?,Really? You're late and making small talk.,I have half a mind to fire you. Don't you ever show up late to my meetings again.,You really are stupid you know that. Holding me up like this. I can't believe you ever passed the ASVAB with a brain as dumb as yours. Jeez man.
So how was your breakfast this morning? ,I see you had a good meal before you got here. ,Its so nice to see you first thing! ,"Hello, how is your morning going? Good I hope! ",I'm glad to hear that your breakfast was good enough to be late. ,"I'm sure that the NCO outside needed to hear all about what you ate, while you were 15 minutes late. ",You would think as a higher NCO that you would know the importance of showing up on time. ,Did you lose all sense of respect or do you just not care about being on time anymore? 
"SFC Smothers, how was your breakfast this morning? I know you have had some little mishaps here lately so lets work on our communication skills. ","SFC Smothers, I think our communication is lacking a tad bit so lets meet more often and see how things are going. Then maybe I can give you some advice and help you with some skills. ","SFC Smothers, I am a little disappointed that you missed our original meeting. However, we all can work on having better communication skills. Lets talk about that and it will help with the issues in this counseling as well. ","SFC Smothers, you are a great leader to your soldiers. They are loyal and trustworthy but you just need to communicate better with them. Every leader can always work on that one aspect.  ","SFC Smothers, not communicating with your soldiers is an issue. They put their trust and faith in you as a leader and you disappointed them. If they feel like you are not doing your job then they wont want to work for you. ","SFC Smothers, its sad that you are lacking in communication skills. As a leader you need to be more aware of what is happening or needs to get done. Your soldiers look for your guidance and they are not getting anything from you. ","SFC Smothers, you missed our meeting. Instead you were too busy with food instead of your career. That is a real problem and you need to figure out your priorities. ","SFC Smothers, you are irresponsible and thats not a trait of a leader. You need to rethink your actions and choices you have made. Maybe you are not fit to be a leader. "

I couldn't help to overhear of your pleasant morning.  It sounds very nice.,I heard your squad executed an efficient and speedy police detail the other day.  That is very impressive.,"I am pleasant to report that overall, the squads have been performing very well, and some leaders are definitely standing out.",A soldier in your squad has really risen up and is being recognized by many of my colleagues.  Your hand in his development was also noticed.,"2 weeks ago, in the hour and a half that was wasted, one of your squad members left out of frustration.  He got in a tragic car wreck and his family decided late last night to take him off of life support.","Your wife brought your daughter up here this morning.  I had brought in breakfast for us all to share before our meeting, but unfortunately you did not get here on time.","Unfortunately, your leadership has been less than impressive.

I am questioning your ability to do this job.","I know about your inability to lead in the way yu have been instructed to.  You clearly have no understanding of your wrongdoing, but fortunately I will devote this next hour to explaining it to you.  You are arrogant while unable to deliver."

I have been considering rewarding them if you continue to improve and put forth your best work.","SSG Rogers, you are a hardworking member of this branch, and though others may not notice your good work, I respect your attitude and work ethic. I just know that you can become one of the best here if you continue to work hard and improve yourself.","SSG Rogers, I could not be any more disappointed in you for neglecting your duties. You not only harm your reputation through these errors, but you also risk endangering the work and lives of others.","SSG Rogers, it is with heavy heart that I must send you home for your repeated infractions. You may return after a few days and resume your work, but I cannot tolerate any more. I know that you are capable of better.","SSG Rogers, I cannot believe that you seem to care more about your favorite breakfast than you do your duties here! You are a sad excuse for a soldier, and I wonder how you ever joined our ranks. You are highly incompetent and utterly pathetic.","SSG Rogers, you cannot seem to even perform basic tasks like shwoing up for counseling. You are a lowly worm in my eyes. How do your men put up with you? You need to suck it up and do better. Otherwise, you can leave."

Smothers was really relaxed and he pretty much ignored any attention that goes around him.,Smothers is way too comforted in his position.,"Well smothers felt lazy at first, but then a meeting just came up and he dashed with excitement.","When there is a call that came up, he rushed to the store and got all the goods for the session with enthusiasm.","When was being too comfortable, he was enjoying watching television, but then he realizes that he was late for the session.","smother was lazy, then he got yelled at by a supervisor for talking about things irrelevant and also showing up late for the session.","He was so calm with everything flying by him, but then he got a called from Rogers about his fat bum sitting all day for nothing. Then he got angry. (Smothers)","Smother was just watching some cat videos online, but then its 8:00 and he got mad at his clock and he destroyed it with anger."
Smothers i want you to just chill the way you are and pretty much the whole day is yours.,"Here is a fruit punch Smothers, hope you are enjoying your free day.","Hey smothers, you are getting a raise and i want you to celebrate by chilling!","Come to the session Smothers, there is something interesting going on and i want you to come and check it out! Don't be late!","Smothers, you bother call yourself a sergeant! You are a lazy fat bum who sits on a comfy chair just eating his donuts. Get your sluggish act together.",You are a big sack of crap who wastes his whole day doing nothing besides bragging about nonsense.,"Hey Smothers you are fat!! Look at you, you're just thinking being comfortable is going to make you look good! Get your bum up and don't be late to that dang meeting!",You are a sorry excuse for a human. A man who just sits there and wasting his time and not getting ready for the important session that needs to be taken care of.
