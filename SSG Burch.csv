I've had a few rows of my own, but when things start getting to you, you know my door is open. Or you can always stop by the Counseling Clinic for some advice.

You should be ashamed of yourself!"
"SSG Burch, I can assure you that you have been doing such a great job in this position. I am very sorry to hear about all of this.
